# ESLint Rules Plugin

This plugin provides additional ESLint rules for the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) static code analysis tool.

## Getting Started

This plugin is installed as a dependency of the `booking-app` package. If you changed rules in this plugin  you need to rebuild this package to apply the changes.

To rebuild the `eslint-plugin` package, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
npm run build:eslint-plugin
```
